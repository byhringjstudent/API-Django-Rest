## Introduction and Overview

### [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/)
To start, we first need to understand what Django is. Django is the most popular web framework in the Python ecosystem, characterized by its high-level structure that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design. It has been constructed by experienced developers and aims to mitigate the hassles of web development; this allows developers to focus their attention on writing their app without feeling the need to reinvent the wheel. Django is a free and open-source framework that is ingrained in the model-template-views architectural pattern. Its maintenance is overseen by the Django Software Foundation, an independent, non-profit organization based in the United States.

### [Django Rest Framework](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/)
The Django Rest Framework is a powerful library constructed on top of Django, with a unique interlinking to the Django Model. This relationship endows Django with the enhanced ability to create APIs(application programming interfaces).

An important thing to know about Django is how the information usually flows

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram 
    participant B as Browser
    participant DS as Django Server
    participant UP as URL Patterns 
    participant V as View
    
    B->>DS: Sends HTTP request 
    DS->>UP: Matches HTTP request to URL patterns
    UP->>V: Calls appropriate View with request object 
    V-->>UP: Response object
    UP-->>DS: Returns HTTP response
    DS-->>B: JSON response(in our case)
```

The sequence diagram illustrates the flow of an HTTP request through the Django web framework. Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Browser Sends HTTP Request:** The process begins when the user interacts with the browser, triggering an HTTP request. This request is sent to the Django server.

2. **Django Server Receives Request:** Upon receiving the request, the Django server forwards it to the URL dispatcher (URL Patterns) to determine which view function should handle it.

3. **URL Patterns Match Request to View:** The URL dispatcher matches the incoming HTTP request to the appropriate view function based on the URL patterns defined in the Django project. It then calls the corresponding view function, passing along the request object.

4. **View Processes Request:** The view function performs the necessary processing based on the request received. This could involve querying the database, performing business logic, or any other required tasks. Once the processing is complete, the view returns a response object.

5. **Response Travels Back:** The response object generated by the view function travels back through the same path it came from, starting with the URL dispatcher. The response is passed back to the Django server.

6. **HTTP Response Returned:** The Django server sends the HTTP response, typically in the form of JSON data in your case, back to the browser, fulfilling the original request.

This sequence outlines the typical flow of a request-response cycle in Django, demonstrating how requests are handled and responses are generated within the framework.
